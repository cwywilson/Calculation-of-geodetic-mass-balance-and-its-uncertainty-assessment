# ANP Glacier Change Detection Workflow

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that processes and analyzes glacier surface elevation changes in Auyuittuq National Park using geodetic differencing of digital elevation models (DEMs). It utilizes the [XDEM](https://github.com/GlacioHack/xdem) library and associated geospatial tools for loading, visualizing, and comparing DEMs.

## Features

* Load and inspect coregistered differenced DEMs (`dDEM`)
* Load reference DEMs for validation
* Visualize elevation differences and reference data
* Prepare geospatial windows and masks for detailed analysis

## Credits

This workflow builds upon the [XDEM project](https://github.com/GlacioHack/xdem), developed by the GlacioHack community.
